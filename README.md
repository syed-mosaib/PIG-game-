# PIG-game-
A fun and interactive dice game developed in Python. The PIG game is a two-player game where players take turns to roll a die. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players can choose to hold their score at any time, but rolling a 1 resets the current turn's score to zero.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played with two players.
2. Each player takes turns to roll a die.
3. On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they wish.
   - If they roll a 1, they score no points for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn.
   - If they roll any other number, it is added to their turn total.
4. A player can choose to "hold" their score at any time, adding their turn total to their total score and ending their turn.
5. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
